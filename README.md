## 🎯 Problem Statement

> **Design a multi-agent system that takes ownership of a complex, multi-step enterprise process.** It should detect failures, self-correct, and complete the job with minimal human involvement — while keeping an auditable trail of every decision it makes.

We were challenged to build one of the following:

| Category | Description |
|---|---|
| **Process Orchestration Agents** | Manage business workflows like procurement-to-payment, employee onboarding, or contract lifecycle with built-in exception handling |
| **Meeting Intelligence Systems** | Extract decisions, create tasks, assign owners, track completion, and escalate stalls — all without manual follow-up |
| **Multi-Agent Collaboration Setups** | Where specialized agents (data retrieval, decision-making, action execution, verification) work together to complete complex tasks |
| **Workflow Health Monitors** | Catch process drift, predict bottlenecks, and reroute or escalate before SLA breaches happen |

---

## 💡 Our Solution

We built a **Fully Autonomous Multi-Agent AI Code Intelligence & Remediation Platform** — an enterprise-grade system where **six specialized AI agents** collaborate autonomously to analyze codebases, detect vulnerabilities, prioritize issues, **generate and apply fixes**, and verify solutions — all without human intervention. Plus, it **automatically commits and pushes** changes back to your repository.

Think of it as a **self-healing code review system** where:
- 🔍 **Retriever Agent** fetches your code
- 🧪 **Analyzer Agent** finds issues via AI
- ⚖️ **Decision Agent** prioritizes them
- ⚡ **Execution Agent** generates fixes
- ✅ **Verifier Agent** validates them
- 📊 **Monitor Agent** watches for failures
- 🚀 **NEW: Auto-execution** applies fixes to files
- 📤 **NEW: Auto-commit/push** deploys changes
- 🔗 **NEW: Webhooks** auto-trigger on GitHub push
- ⏰ **NEW: Background jobs** monitor continuously

### Why This Matters?

Enterprise codebases are massive, complex, and constantly evolving. Manual code reviews are:
- ⏳ **Slow** — bottlenecks in development cycles
- 🔓 **Error-prone** — human reviewers miss vulnerabilities  
- 📉 **Inconsistent** — quality varies across reviewers
- 👤 **Manual fixes** — developers spend days on remediation
- 📦 **No auto-deployment** — changes stuck in review limbo

Our platform eliminates all of this with AI agents that analyze → fix → commit → push, all automatically.

## 🧠 Multi-Agent Architecture

Our system is powered by **six specialized agents**, each with a distinct role in the pipeline:

### Agent Details

| Agent | Role | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| 🔍 **Retriever Agent** | Data Retrieval | Traverses the provided GitHub repository URL or uploaded files, fetches source code, and prepares it for downstream analysis |
| 🧪 **Analyzer Agent** | Intelligence | Leverages **Google Gemini AI** to perform deep code analysis — identifying security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, code smells, and quality issues |
| ⚖️ **Decision Agent** | Decision-Making | Evaluates findings from the Analyzer, assigns severity scores (Critical / High / Medium / Low), and prioritizes them into an actionable task queue |
| ⚡ **Execution Agent** | Action | Develops implementation strategies and generates detailed, context-aware fix plans for each identified issue |
| ✅ **Verifier Agent** | Verification | Validates that identified issues are legitimate (reducing false positives) and that proposed solutions are sound and won't introduce regressions |
| 📊 **Monitor Agent** | Observability | Provides end-to-end tracking of agent health, workflow status, throughput metrics, and SLA compliance across the entire pipeline |

## 📐 Evaluation Criteria Alignment

Our solution is designed to excel across all evaluation dimensions:

| Criterion | How We Address It |
|---|---|
| **Depth of Autonomy** | ✅ **95%+ autonomous** — Webhooks trigger → Analysis runs → Fixes applied → Code committed & pushed (only setup is one-time webhook config) |
| **Error Recovery** | ✅ **Multi-layer recovery** — Verifier catches false positives, Monitor detects failures, Scheduler retries, logging tracks all issues |
| **Auditability** | ✅ **Complete audit trail** — Every step timestamped (agent transition, decision reasoning, fix applied, commit hash, push status) |
| **Real-World Applicability** | ✅ **Production-ready** — GitHub integration, git-based deployment, scheduled jobs, security-first design (token handling, signature verification) |

### Autonomy Breakdown

```
Total Steps: 10
Automated: 9-10 (depending on setup)
Manual: 0-1 (optional GitHub webhook config)
→ Autonomy: 90-100%
```
